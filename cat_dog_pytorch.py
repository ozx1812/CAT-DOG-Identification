"""
Transfer Learning
we will use pre-trained networks to solved challenging problems in computer vision.
here we will use Neural Net trained on ImageNet dataset .

ImageNet is a massive dataset with over 1 million labeled images in 1000 categories.
It's used to train deep neural networks using an architecture called convolutional layers. 

Using a pre-trained network on images not in the training set is called transfer learning. 
Here we'll use transfer learning to train a network that can classify our cat and dog photos with near perfect accuracy.
