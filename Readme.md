# Transfer Learning

<h2>ImageNet</h2> is a massive dataset with over 1 million labeled images in 1000 categories. It's used to train deep neural networks using an architecture called convolutional layers. I'm not going to get into the details of convolutional networks here, but if you want to learn more about them, please watch this.


With torchvision.models you can download these pre-trained networks and use them in your applications. We'll include models in our imports now.
